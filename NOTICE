This project was developed at the chair of computational and plasma physics of
the Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) Munich under the supervision of Prof.
Dr.  Hartmut Ruhl.

Funding was provided by the Munich Cluster of Excellence (MAP), by the
international Max-Planck Research School for Advanced Photonic Sciences
(IMPRS-APS), by the Transregio TR-18 project B12, and the German Research
Foundation (DFG) under Grant Nos. 416611371, 416607684 within the Research Unit
FOR 2783.
Large parts of the computations during the production and verification process
have been performed on the KSC cluster computing system of the Arnold
Sommerfeld Center (ASC) for Theoretical Physics at LMU Munich, hosted at the
Leibniz-Rechenzentrum (LRZ) in Garching and funded by the German Research
Foundation under the project number 409562408.
