This work was produced at the chair of computational and plasma physics of the Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) Munich under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Hartmut Ruhl.  
Funding was provided by the Munich Cluster of Excellence (MAP), by the international Max-Planck Research School for Advanced Photonic Sciences (IMPRS-APS), by the Transregio TR-18 project B12, and the German Research Foundation (DFG) under Grant No. 416699545 within the Research Unit FOR 2783/1.  
Large parts of the computations during the production and verification process have been performed on the KSC cluster computing system of the Arnold Sommerfeld Center (ASC) for theoretical physics at LMU Munich, hosted at the Leibniz-Rechenzentrum (LRZ) in Garching and funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under the project number 409562408.
